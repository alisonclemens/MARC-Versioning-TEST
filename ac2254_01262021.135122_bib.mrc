The first volume contains a variety of reports: 13 community analysis reports (nos. 1-11, 13-14) explore Japanese-American culture and causes of unrest at relocation centers. 22 project analysis series reports contain reports from individual internment camps on army registration, religious cults, newly developed Japanese words related to relocation, and labor relations disputes. 12 community analysis notes (nos. 1-7, 9-12, 14) include interviews with Japanese-Americans and summaries of the integration of Japanese-Americans in California communities. 25 weekly summaries, dated December 1944 to June 1945 record reactions by interned Japanese-Americans to plans to close the centers within a year.   aA volume of administrative instructions contains over 90 policy memoranda from the War Relocation Authority concerning personnel and camp operation as well as other issues such as absentee voting rights of American citizen evacuees. A small section at the end of this volume contains solicitor's opinions, which are duplicated in the more complete third volume of nearly 90 legal opinions from the Office of the Solicitor at the War Relocation Authority. These opinions address a variety of questions, including "the extent to which Japanese may validly be detained, or their movements restricted, under an exercise of the war power" and "ways in which American citizenship may be lost."  aAccompanied by container list (in box 1).  aPurchased from Sotheby's New York on the Frederick W. & Carrie S.
